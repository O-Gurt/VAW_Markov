## Abstract

Given a trajectory of a stationary $\beta$-mixing Markov process $X$, we estimate the conditional expectation of a fixed bounded function depending on $s$ future values of $X$. We show that an $L^2$-consistent estimator can be obtained as a linear combination with uniformly bounded coefficients of sufficiently large set of random Fourier features. The coefficients are constructed by the Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth algorithm, introduced in the framework of online linear regression.
